Unknown:
X = (x,y,z) the position of the node to be located

Input:
Xi = (xi,yi,zi) 1 <= i <= N the position of the anchors
D = [ di ] the distances between the node and each of the anchors
X0 the initial assumed value of X, to be refined incrementally

Definitions:

ri	= di - |X-Xi| the residuals
	= di - sqrt( (x-xi)² + (y-yi)² + (z-zi)² )

R	= [ ri ]

∂ri/∂w	= (wi-w) / |X-Xi|	w = x,y,z

J	= [ [ ∂ri/∂x, ∂ri/∂y, ∂ri/∂z ] ] the Jacobian matrix

Refinement process:

X <- X - (J'J)⁻¹J'R

The process stops after a given number of iterations, or when the difference is smaller than a threshold
