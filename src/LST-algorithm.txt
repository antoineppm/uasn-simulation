This is a description of a multi-stage, TOA-based localization scheme: "Large-Scale Time-of-arrival" (LST)

Each unlocalized node makes, in turn, a request. Nearby localized nodes reply. The node measures the time it took to receive each reply, and caclulates its position. It can now serve as anchor for other nearby nodes.

TODO: reduce the number of replies (if needed)
TODO: implement passive TDoA to speed up localization

AVOIDING COLLISIONS

Each node is assigned a timeslot. They can only make requests or broadcast their position during that timeslot.

NODE STATUS

UNLOCALIZED/waiting
node that does not know its position, and is not ready to make a request
"position"		if 3 registered neighbors or more -> /ready

UNLOCALIZED/ready
node that does not know its position, and is ready to make a request
on timeslot		send "call", set timer (1 timeslot), -> /localizing

UNLOCALIZED/localizing
node that does not know its position, and is in the process of finding it
"reply"			register data
on timeout		try calculating position
calc. success	-> LOCALIZED/new
calc. failure	-> /waiting

LOCALIZED/new
node that knows its position but haven't broadcast it yet
on timeslot		send "position"

LOCALIZED/idle
node that knows its position, and can reply to requests
"request"		send "reply"

MESSAGES

All message have the following format:
sender object data

sender 		the name of the node sending the message
object		identifies the type of message
data		additional information (there can be no data)

"position" x y z
Position broadcast from a newly localized node

"call"
Localization request from an unlocalized node

"reply"
Reply to the above from a localized node
