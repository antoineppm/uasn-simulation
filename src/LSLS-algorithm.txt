This is a description of a multi-stage, TDOA-based localization scheme

WE ARE ASSUMING THAT TRANSMISSIONS ARE NEVER LOST

Node life cycle:
unlocalized -> localized -> anchor -> localized (repeat as needed)

Some nodes must be localized at the beginning of the simulation (initial anchors)

COMMUNICATION FORMAT

transmission have the following format:
"sender object [data]"
The data is zero or more elements separated by whitespace

The localization process consists in two repeating steps:
- anchor selection
- beaconing sequence

1) MASTER ANCHOR SELECTION

For the very first localization cycle, a designated master anchor starts the process by sending out a message (subject: "anchor", data: 0, x, y, z, "")
For the subsequent localization cycles, the newly located nodes become master anchor candidates (upon the last beacon) and go through the selection process below using the distance to the center of the previous anchors for D.

2) ANCHOR SELECTION PROCESS

A localized nodes can become an anchor by following the following steps:

CANDIDACY: upon receiving a "anchor" message of level N-1, the node becomes an anchor candidate of level N (needs to have been a candidate for the previous levels except 0) and sets a timer: K*f(R,D)/v
- v speed of sound
- R max transmission range
- D distance to the activating anchor
- f function that is 0 at the desired optimal range, positive otherwise up to R
- K a factor large enough to prevent most premature confirmations
If a "confirm" message is received before the timer ends, the node is eliminated

ELIMINATION: If the timer runs out before being interrupted, it sends a confirmation message (subject: "confirm", data: N, f(R,D), parent) and sets a timer: 2R
If a "confirm" message is received before the timer ends, and bears a smaller f factor, the node is eliminated

REPETITION: If the timer runs out without being eliminated, the candidate becomes the anchor of level N and sends out a message (subject: "anchor", data: N, x, y, z, parent)

Unlocalized nodes listen in to this process and register the name and position of the anchors they will be using.

3) BEACONING SEQUENCE

The master anchor sends out a fixed number of messages at regular intervals (subject: "beacon", data: count, 0).
The subsequent anchors, when receiving a message from their parent, calculate the total delay since the transmission by the master anchor, and send a message in turn (subject: "beacon", data: count, N, delay).
Once unlocalized nodes have received all beacons, they attempt to calculate their position using this data.

NOTES

Since only newly localized nodes can be master candidates, the process will naturally end when no more nodes are localized.
It might be preferable to use different f functions for master and slave anchors:
- master: f = 0 at max range, to ensure the new anchor sets appear on the borders of the localized area
- slaves: f = 0 at mid range, so the anchor set is tight enough to locate nodes outside their envelope, but not so much that localization is hugely imprecise

HANDLING COLLISIONS

If a node is in range of several would-be anchors, there needs to be a way to keep the anchr set consistent.
- all "anchor" and "confirm" messages include the name of the parent anchor (if level 0, an empty string).
- if a "candidate" node receives an "anchor" message of parent level, it figures out if it is a better fit (if the timer would end earlier) and adopts the new parent if it is the case.
- a "confirming" node is locked into its parent, however.
- "localized" nodes establish lists of all the anchor chains they can hear. Once one of these lists is complete, they become a "listening" node. After a certain time without receiving any "anchor" message, the anchor lists are wiped.

STATUS SPECIFICATION

UNLOCALIZED
If anchor list complete				-> LISTENING
If "beacon" message				wipe anchor lists

LISTENING
If TDOA algorithm successful			-> CANDIDATE (0)
If TDOA algorithm unsuccessful			-> UNLOCALIZED

LOCALIZED (N)
If "anchor" (N-1) message			-> CANDIDATE (N)
If "beacon" message				reset level to 1

CANDIDATE (N)
If "anchor" (N-1) message, better		change parent
If "anchor" (N) message				-> LOCALIZED (1) or CANDIDATE (N+1)
If "confirm" (N) message			-> LOCALIZED (N%3+1)
If timer runs out				-> CONFIRMING (N)

CONFIRMING (N)
If "confirm" (N) message, better		-> LOCALIZED (N%3+1)
If timer runs out				-> ANCHOR (N)

ANCHOR (N)
If timer runs out				start beaconing
If beaconing finished				-> LOCALIZED (1)
